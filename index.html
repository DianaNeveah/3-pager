<h3>Something Cool About Me</h3>
<p>My name is DianaNeveah, and that is my first name. My mom wanted to name me Diana and my dad wanted to name me Nevaeh, so to try to win, my dad rushed and got a tattoo that said Nevaeh on his arm, except he didn't. He was in such a hurry, he spelled it wrong and put Neveah. But my mom always gets what she wants, so they decided on DianaNeveah. I really like my name, it's super unique of course. although it was pretty hard as a 2 year old in preschool to try to spell that long name, so ever since I started school, I go by Diana because its easier that way.</p>
<p>I would consider myself a people person, I am not shy, growing up we moved back and fourth a lot from Bakersfield to Fresno so I had to get used to making new friends alot of the time. I also think my people skills come from the fact that I have 9 siblings, so there was always people around me. However I only live with the 5 that came from my momma and I see the other 4 occasionally. With seeing them all comes quite a bit of traveling, my older sister lives in Arizona, I have been there once to see her and when she comes to see me, we meet up in Bakersfield, that is where the rest of my family lives and where I was born. </p>
